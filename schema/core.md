# Core Schema

Core schema contains a set of common metadata fields that all catalog
records share and consists largely of high-level dataset attributes
and properties. This document outlines the **required** and **recommended**
high-level properties to create schemas for the I-Guide catalog records.

## Required Metadata

|Property|Type (class)|Expected children Type (subclass) and DataType|Cardinality|Description| 
|---|---|---|---|---|
|name|Thing|Text|1|the name or title of the item| 
|description|Thing|Text|1|the description or abstract of the item|
|url|Thing|URL|1|the url of the item|
|creator|Creative Work|Person OR Organization|1+| person or organization that created the work|
|dateCreated | CreativeWork | Date \| DateTime | 1 | The date on which the work was created|
|keywords | CreativeWork | DefinedTerm \| Text \| URL |	1+ | Keywords or tags used to describe the dataset, delimited by commas. |
|license | CreativeWork | CreativeWork \| URL | 1 | A license document that applies to the content, typically indicated by a URL |
|provider | Creative Work | Organization \| Person | 1 | The service provider, service operator, or service performer |

The following examples demonstrate how each of these required properties may
be implemented in `JSON+LD`. Note, there are several properties omitted from each
example such as `@context` and `@type`. 

### Name, Description, and URL
**Name**, **Description**, and **URL** are properties inherited from the
Schema.org `Thing` class. These are common properties that all Schema.org types
contain. A simple example is shown below:

``` json
{
  ...
  "name": "IGUIDE Sample Dataset",
  "description": "This is a sample datasets used in the I-GUIDE Catalog documentation",
  "url": "https://my-unique-url.com/9d413b9d1"
}
```

### Creator

**Creator** is a property of the `CreativeWork` class. The purpose of this
property is to describe the author or authors of a catalog record. The
recommended way to express authorship of a CreativeWork is shown below. Note,
this approach was adopted from ESIP Science on Schema Org.

A single author can be expressed as:

``` json
  ...
  "creator": {
    "@type": "Person",
    "name": "John Doe",
    "email": "john.doe@email.com",
  }
```

A more complete example of an author will include additional fields from the
`Person` class such as an identifier.

``` json
  ...
  "creator": {
    "@type": "Person",
    "name": "John Doe",
    "email": "john.doe@email.com",
    "identifier": {
      "@type": "PropertyValue",
      "@id": "https://orcid.org/0000-0000-0000-0001",
      "propertyID": "https://registry.identifiers.org/registry/orcid",
      "url": "https://orcid.org/0000-0000-0000-0001",
      "value": "0000-0000-0000-0001"
    }
  }
```

For multiple authors, the `@list` keyword is used such that the order of
creators is preserved.

``` json
  ...
  "creator": {
    "@list":[
      {
        "@type": "Person",
        "name": "John Doe",
        "email": "john.doe@email.com",
        "identifier": {
          "@id": "https://orcid.org/0000-0000-0000-0001",
          "@type": "PropertyValue",
          "propertyID": "https://registry.identifiers.org/registry/orcid",
          "url": "https://orcid.org/0000-0000-0000-0001",
          "value": "0000-0000-0000-0001"
        }
      },
      {
        "@type": "Person",
        "name": "Jane Doe",
        "email": "jane.doe@email.com",
        "identifier": {
          "@id": "https://orcid.org/0000-0000-0000-0002",
          "@type": "PropertyValue",
          "propertyID": "https://registry.identifiers.org/registry/orcid",
          "url": "https://orcid.org/0000-0000-0000-0002",
          "value": "0000-0000-0000-0002"
        }
      }
    ]
  }

```

### Date Created

**DateCreated** is a property of `CreativeWork` that can be expressed using
either the `Date` or `DateTime` classes. The **dateCreated** represents the
date at which the dataset was initially generated. The `Date` class expects a
value in [ISO 8601 date format](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_8601). Whereas
the `DateTime` class requires a combination of date and time of day. An
example if each is provided below.

``` json
{
  ...
  "dateCreated": "2023-01-01",
}

```

``` json
{
  ...
  "dateCreated": "2023-01-01T00:00:00+00:00",
}

```

### Keywords

**Keywords** is a property of `CreativeWork` that can be expressed using either
the `DefinedTerm`, `Text`, or `URL` Schema.org classes. Keywords are tags used
to describe the catalog record and are primarily used for resource discovery.
**Keywords** are typically provided as a list of items, but can also done by
repeating the **Keyword** property. Several examples are listed below.

``` json
{
  ...
  "keywords": ["keyword 1", "keyword 2", "keyword 3"],
}
```

``` json
{
  ...
  "keywords": {
    "@type": "DefinedTerm",
    "name": "Leaf wetness",
    "description": "The effect of moisture settling on the surface of a leaf as a result of either condensation or rainfall.",
    "inDefinedTermSet": "http://his.cuahsi.org/mastercvreg/edit_cv11.aspx?tbl=VariableNameCV",
  }
}
```

``` json
{
  ...
  "keywords": [
    {
      "@type": "DefinedTerm",
      "name": "Leaf wetness",
      "description": "The effect of moisture settling on the surface of a leaf as a result of either condensation or rainfall.",
      "inDefinedTermSet": "http://his.cuahsi.org/mastercvreg/edit_cv11.aspx?tbl=VariableNameCV",
    },
    {
      "@type": "DefinedTerm",
      "name": "Core",
      "description": "Core sample resulting in a section of a substance",
      "inDefinedTermSet": "http://his.cuahsi.org/mastercvreg/edit_cv11.aspx?tbl=SampleTypeCV",
    }
  ]
}
```

### License 

**License** is a property of the `CreativeWork` class and can be expressed as
another `CreativeWork` or as a `URL`. A license is a document that applies to
the content of the catalog record, for example a software license. 

``` json
{
  ...
  "license": "https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/",
}
```

``` json
{
  ...
  "license": {
    "@type": "CreativeWork",
    "name": "My custom license",
    "url": "https://my-custom-license.com/license.txt"
    }
}
```

### Provider

**Provider** is a property of the `CreativeWork` class that can be expressed as
either an `Organization` or a `Person`. This represents the service operator,
service performer, or goods producer. In many cases this is the operator of the
repository in which the data resides.

``` json
{
  ...
  "provider": {
    "@type": "Organization",
    "name": "HydroShare",
    "url": "https://hydroshare.org",
    "parentOrganization": {
      "@type": "Organization",
      "name": CUAHSI,
      "url": "www.cuahsi.org",
      "address": "1167 Massachusetts Ave Suites 418 & 419, Arlington, MA 02476"
    }
  }
}
```

``` json
{
  ...
  "provider": {
    "@id": "https://hydroshare.org",
  }
}
```

``` json
{
  ...
  "provider": {
    "@type": "Person",
    "name": "John Doe",
    "email": "jdoe@email.com",
  }
}
```

Note: for a more complete example of `Person`, see the [Creator](#creator)
section of this document.

## Recommended Metadata

|Property|Class|Type|Cardinality|Description| 
|---|---|---|---|---|
|creativeWorkStatus | CreativeWork | DefinedTerm \| Text | 0,1 | The status of a creative work in terms of its stage in a lifecycle. Example terms include Incomplete, Draft, Published, Obsolete. Some organizations define a set of terms for the stages of their publication lifecycle.|
|dateModified |	CreativeWork |Date \| DateTime | 0,1| The date on which the CreativeWork was most recently modified or updated. | 
|funding| CreativeWork | Grant | 0+ | A Grant that directly or indirectly provide funding or sponsorship for creation of the dataset.|
|temporalCoverage|CreativeWork|DateTime| 1 | The temporalCoverage of a CreativeWork indicates the period that the content applies to, i.e. that it describes, either as a DateTime or as a textual string indicating a time period in ISO 8601 time interval format. |
|spatialCoverage|CreativeWork|Place| 1 | The spatialCoverage of a CreativeWork indicates the place(s) which are the focus of the content. It is a subproperty of contentLocation intended primarily for more technical and detailed materials. For example with a Dataset, it indicates areas that the dataset describes: a dataset of New York weather would have spatialCoverage which was the place: the state of New York.|
|hasPart|CreativeWork|CreativeWork|0+|Indicates an item or CreativeWork that is part of this item|
|isPartOf|CreativeWork|CreativeWork OR URL |0+|Indicates an item or CreativeWork that this item, or CreativeWork (in some sense), is part of.|
|associatedMedia|CreativeWork|MediaObject|0+| A media object that encodes this CreativeWork. This property is a synonym for encoding.|

Note: `hasPart` and `isPartOf` are generally used for records that are grouped
together or records that belong to other groupings. For example, `hasPart` may
be used to indicate a record that consists of one or more additional
CreativeWork (this is similar to a HydroShare collection). In contrast,
`isPartOf` is used to indicate catalog records that reference a designated
CreativeWork. As such, these are not demonstrated in the example below.


### Creative Work Status

**CreativeWorkStatus** is a property of `CreativeWork` used to capture the
stage of a work's lifecycle; incomplete, draft, published, obsolete, etc. This
can be expressed as text or using the `DefinedTerm` class.

``` json
{
  ...
  
  "creativeWorkStatus": "published",
```

A more expressive status can be provided using the `DefinedTerm` subtype.
``` json
{
  ...
  
  "creativeWorkStatus": {
    "@type": "DefinedTerm",
    "name": "public",
    "description": "a publicly accessible dataset on HydroShare.org"
  }
}
```

### Date Modified

**DateModified** is a property of `CreativeWork` that can be expressed using
either the `Date` or `DateTime` classes. **DateModified** represents the
date at which the dataset was most recently modified. The `Date` class expects a
value in [ISO 8601 date format](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_8601). Whereas
the `DateTime` class requires a combination of date and time of day. An
example if each is provided below.

``` json
{
  ...
  "dateModified": "2023-01-01",
}

```

``` json
{
  ...
  "dateModified": "2023-01-01T00:00:00+00:00",
}

```

### Funding

**Funding** is a property of the `CreativeWork` class used to describe the
grant(s) that directly or indirectly funded or sponsored the work. **Funding**
is expressed using the `Grant` subtype.

``` json
{
  ...
  "funding":
  {
    "@type": "MonetaryGrant",
    "name": "My research project",
     "url": "https://www.nsf.gov/awardsearch/showAward?AWD_ID=000001",
     "funder": {
        "@type": "Organization",
        "name": "National Science Foundation"
      }
    }
```

Multiple funding sources can be expressed as a list:

``` json
{
  ...
  "funding": [
  {
    "@type": "MonetaryGrant",
    "name": "My first research project",
     "url": "https://www.nsf.gov/awardsearch/showAward?AWD_ID=000001",
     "funder": {
        "@type": "Organization",
        "name": "National Science Foundation"
      }
    },
  {
    "@type": "MonetaryGrant",
    "name": "My second research project",
     "url": "https://www.nsf.gov/awardsearch/showAward?AWD_ID=000002",
     "funder": {
        "@type": "Organization",
        "name": "National Science Foundation"
      }
    }
  ]
}
```

### Temporal Coverage

**TemporalCoverage** is a property of the `CreativeWork` class that is used to
define a period of time in which the catalog record applies to. This should be
expressed using the `DateTime` subtype.

``` json
{
  ...
  "temporalCoverage": "2007-03-01T13:00:00Z/2008-05-11T15:30:00Z",
}
```

### Spatial Coverage

**SpatialCoverage** is a property of the `CreativeWork` class that is used to
indicate the location for which the content is valid. This can also be used to
indicate the focus area of the content. This should be expressed using the
`Place` subtype. There are numerous ways to describe the location of content,
below are several common ones.

A generic location may look like this:

``` json 
{
  ...
  "spatialCoverage": {
    "@type": "Place",
    "name": "CUAHSI Office",
    "address": "1167 Massachusetts Ave Suites 418 & 419, Arlington, MA 02476",
  }

}
```

A geographic point may look like this (from [SOSO](https://github.com/ESIPFed/science-on-schema.org/blob/master/guides/Dataset.md#spatial-coverage)):

``` json 
{
  ...
  "spatialCoverage": {
    "@type": "Place",
    "geo": {
      "@type": "GeoCoordinates",
      "latitude": 39.3280
      "longitude": 120.1633
    }
  }
}
```

A geographic vector may look like this (from [SOSO](https://github.com/ESIPFed/science-on-schema.org/blob/master/guides/Dataset.md#spatial-coverage)):

``` json 
{
  ...
    "spatialCoverage": {
    "@type": "Place",
    "geo": {
      "@type": "GeoShape",
      "line": "39.3280 120.1633 40.445 123.7878"
    }
  }
}
}
```

A geographic point may look like this (from [SOSO](https://github.com/ESIPFed/science-on-schema.org/blob/master/guides/Dataset.md#spatial-coverage)):

``` json 
{
  ...
    "spatialCoverage": {
    "@type": "Place",
    "geo": {
      "@type": "GeoShape",
      "polygon": "39.3280 120.1633 40.445 123.7878 41 121 39.77 122.42 39.3280 120.1633"
    }
  }
}
```

A geographic bounding box may look like this (from [SOSO](https://github.com/ESIPFed/science-on-schema.org/blob/master/guides/Dataset.md#spatial-coverage)):

``` json
{
  ...
    "spatialCoverage": {
    "@type": "Place",
    "geo": {
      "@type": "GeoShape",
      "box": "39.3280 120.1633 40.445 123.7878"
    }
  }
}
```

Multiple locations can be specific using a list: (from [SOSO](https://github.com/ESIPFed/science-on-schema.org/blob/master/guides/Dataset.md#spatial-coverage)):

``` json
{
  ...
  "spatialCoverage": {
    "@type": "Place",
    "geo": [
      {
        "@type": "GeoCoordinates",
        "latitude": -17.65,
        "longitude": 50
      },
      {
        "@type": "GeoCoordinates",
        "latitude": -19,
        "longitude": 51
      }
    ]
  }
}
```

### Associated Media

**AssocatedMedia** is a property of `CreativeWork` for describing media objects
that encode the work. For example, this may be a text file that represents the
data that is being cataloged. 

A single file can be expressed as:

``` json
{
 ...
 "associatedMedia":
   {
     "@type": "MediaObject",
     "contentUrl": "https://www.my-unique-url.com/9d413b9d1/file1.csv",
     "encodingFormat": "text/csv",
     "contentSize": "50 MB",
     "name": "Data File 1"
   }
}
```

Multiple files can be expressed as:

``` json
{
  ...
  "associatedMedia": [
   {
     "@type": "MediaObject",
     "contentUrl": "https://www.my-unique-url.com/9d413b9d1/file1.csv",
     "encodingFormat": "text/csv",
     "contentSize": "50 MB",
     "name": "Data File 1"
   },
   {
     "@type": "MediaObject",
     "contentUrl": "https://www.my-unique-url.com/9d413b9d1/file2.csv",
     "encodingFormat": "text/csv",
     "contentSize": "25 MB",
     "name": "Data File 2"
   },
   {
     "@type": "MediaObject",
     "contentUrl": "https://www.my-unique-url.com/9d413b9d1/file3.csv",
     "encodingFormat": "text/csv",
     "contentSize": "25 MB",
     "name": "Data File 3"
   }
  ]
}
```

### Data Collections

Collections of records can be expressed using the **hasPart** (and inverse
**isPartOf**) properties of `CreativeWork`.

**Has Part** is used to describe an item or work that is part of the current
item. For example, a body of work may consist of multiple related datasets that
are used for a particular study.


``` json
{
  ...
  "hasPart": {
    "@type": "Dataset",
    "name": "IGUIDE Shapefile Testing Resource",
    "description": "Test HydroShare resource for I-GUIDE",
    "url": "https://www.hydroshare.org/resource/9d413b9d57824a79b8239a5f7c4fdf51/data/contents/HUC6_Harvey_TxLaMsAr.shp?zipped=true&aggregation=true"
  }

}

```

Multiple relations can be defined using a list.

``` json
{
  ...
  "hasPart": [
    {
      "@type": "CreativeWork",
      "name": "IGUIDE Shapefile Testing Resource",
      "description": "Test HydroShare resource for I-GUIDE - Shapefile",
      "url": "https://my-unique-url.com/shapefile",
    },
    {
      "@type": "CreativeWork",
      "name": "IGUIDE GeoTiff Testing Resource",
      "description": "Test HydroShare resource for I-GUIDE - GeoTiff",
      "url": "https://my-unique-url.com/geotiff",
    }
  ]
}

```


**isPartOf** is the inverse property of **hasPart** and may be used to indicate
that a work is part of another collection of works.

``` json
{
  ...
  "name": "IGUIDE Sample Dataset",
  "description": "This is a sample datasets used in the I-GUIDE Catalog documentation",
  "url": "https://my-unique-url.com/9d413b9d1",
  "isPartOf": {
    "@type": "CreativeWork",
    "name": "Collection of Sample Datasets",
    "description": "A collection of sample datasets used by the I-GUIDE team",
    "url": "https://my-unique-url.com/data-collection"
  }
}
```
